## About
This repository will be used for Web Apps. In it I plan to expand existing knowledge of topics such as git and html. Throughout the course I plan to edit this page to contain useful information that will be handy for future use.

## Recommended Tools
1. [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started "Markdown Starting Guide") Markdown was used to create this page and is useful for all git pages due to the simple design making it a fast way to create simple layouts.
1. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ "Notepad++ Home") Notepad++ is an excellent tool for learning HTML and CSS which are both recommended to know when creating pages.
